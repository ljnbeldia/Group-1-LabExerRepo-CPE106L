"""
File: student.py
Resources to manage a student's name and test scores.

Programming Problem:
Add three methods to the Student class (in the file student.py) that compare two Student objects. 
One method should test for equality. A second method should test for less than. The third method should 
test for greater than or equal to. In each case, the method returns the result of the comparison of 
the two studentsâ€™ names. Include a main function that tests all of the comparison operators. (LO: 10.2)
